# changelog.d: one fragment per PR

Every merge to `main` is a release (`.github/workflows/release-on-merge.yml`).
Its version is computed, never edited: the highest `v` tag plus one increment.
A PR declares the increment by adding one fragment here, so the level is part of
what review approves:

```markdown
bump: patch
What changed, for the release notes, in a sentence or a short list.
```

- **The first line** is `bump: patch`, `bump: minor` or `bump: major`, and nothing else.
- **The rest** is the release notes text. The GitHub Release for that version
  shows it, followed by the list of merged PRs.
- **Name it after your branch**, for example `changelog.d/cli-base-install.md`.
- **Optional:** a PR with no fragment is a patch release, with a one-line note.
- **Never edit or delete a merged fragment.** A release reads the fragments added
  since the last release tag, so a merge whose run failed still counts in the
  next release, and older ones stay as history and are never counted again. A
  fragment changed or deleted since the last tag fails the release. This README
  is the only exception.
- **The version** counts from the higher of the last tag and the newest version
  on PyPI, and a version PyPI already has is refused before anything is tagged.
- **Yank a bad release on PyPI; never delete it.** A deleted version drops out of
  PyPI's API, but PyPI still refuses its file names, so the next release would
  compute it again and its upload would fail. If that happens, the tag it left
  stops the following release until a reviewed PR declares a higher bump.

From 0.15.2 on, the GitHub Releases page is the changelog. `CHANGELOG.md` keeps
the history up to 0.15.1.
